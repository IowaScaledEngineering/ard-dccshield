This is the  hardware design files for the Iowa Scaled Engineering ARD-DCCSHIELD.  The ARD-DCCSHIELD is an optoisolated interface for connecting an Arduino to a model railroad DCC control system.  Additionally, the board has provisions for connecting I2C accessories and general purpose I/O lines, as well as optionally (jumper selectably) powering the Arduino off of DCC power.

Like all public Iowa Scaled Engineering designs, the ARD-SHIELD is both open hardware and open source software.  Please refer to the hardware and software license files in this repository for details.
