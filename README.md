This is the  hardware design files for the Iowa Scaled Engineering ARD-DCCSHIELD.  The ARD-DCCSHIELD is an optoisolated interface for connecting an Arduino to a model railroad DCC control system.  Additionally, the board has provisions for connecting I2C accessories and general purpose I/O lines, as well as optionally (jumper selectably) powering the Arduino off of DCC power.

The board is intended to be compatible with various versions of the Arduino DCC decoder library, such as the one maintained on the "Model Railroading with Arduino" website. (http://mrrwa.org/)

Like all public Iowa Scaled Engineering designs, the ARD-SHIELD is both open hardware and open source software.  Please refer to the hardware and software license files in this repository for details.
